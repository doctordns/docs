# &#39;&lt;rsetstmt&gt;&#39; is not declared

 Several functions that were intrinsic to [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] in previous versions have been moved to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace. This makes their functionality more generally available to all programming languages.
