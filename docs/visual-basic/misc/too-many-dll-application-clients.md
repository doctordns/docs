# Too many DLL application clients
The dynamic-link library (DLL) for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] can only accommodate access by a limited number of host applications. Your application and other applications that are [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] hosts (some of which may be accessed by your application) are all attempting to access the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)] DLL at the same time.  
  
## To correct this error  
  
-   Reduce the number of open applications accessing [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](~/includes/vbprvb-md.md)].
