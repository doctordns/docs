## Remarks  
 When this option is used, the application will be subject to virtualization on Windows Vista unless you provide an application manifest in a Win32 Resource file or during a later build step. For more information about virtualization, see [ClickOnce Deployment on Windows Vista](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-deployment-on-windows-vista).
